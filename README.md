the base api url is https://dattebayo-api.onrender.com

This is a Naruto database api.
I used GET requests from the api to get character infoto display on the UI.
I included code for POST request and Promise that unfortunatley done execute properly, but I included the code on how I would execute it. It is commented out.

Common names to search are:
Naruto Uzumaki
Sasuke Uchiha
Itachi Uchiha
Kakashi Hatake
Gaara
And many more...

Make sure to Search the First and Last name.

The character details will display on the UI once a name has been searched.
